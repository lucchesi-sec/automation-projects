# Architecture Decisions: Deployment Pipeline

## 🏗️ Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Project Structure
**Date**: 2025-07-08
**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to organize project files for maintainability and scalability of CI/CD system.

**Decision**: Use standard Python package structure with src/, tests/, and docs/ directories.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Standard Python packaging
- ✅ Easy testing and documentation
- ❌ Slightly more complex import paths

### ADR-002: Core Technology Stack
**Date**: 2025-07-08
**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Choose technologies for comprehensive CI/CD pipeline automation.

**Decision**: Python 3.8+ with Docker, Kubernetes, and multi-cloud support (AWS, Azure, GCP).

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Containerization for consistent deployments
- ✅ Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling
- ✅ Multi-cloud flexibility and vendor independence
- ❌ Increased complexity managing multiple platforms

### ADR-003: Infrastructure as Code
**Date**: 2025-07-08
**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need reproducible and version-controlled infrastructure management.**Decision**: Use Terraform for Infrastructure as Code with state management.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Declarative infrastructure management
- ✅ Version control for infrastructure changes
- ✅ Multi-cloud provider support
- ❌ Learning curve for Terraform syntax

### ADR-004: CI/CD Integration
**Date**: 2025-07-08
**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need integration with existing CI/CD systems and workflows.

**Decision**: Support both GitHub Actions and Jenkins with plugin architecture.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Flexibility to work with existing CI/CD systems
- ✅ Plugin architecture for extensibility
- ✅ Standardized pipeline definitions
- ❌ Increased maintenance for multiple integrations

### ADR-005: Monitoring and Observability
**Date**: 2025-07-08
**Status**: Proposed

**Context**: Need comprehensive monitoring for deployment health and performance.

**Decision**: Use Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Industry-standard monitoring stack
- ✅ Rich visualization and alerting capabilities
- ✅ Excellent Kubernetes integration
- ❌ Additional infrastructure components to manage
