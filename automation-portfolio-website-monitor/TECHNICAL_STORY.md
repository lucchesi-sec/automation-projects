# Technical Story: Website Monitor

## ðŸ“– Development Journey

### The Challenge
Website downtime and performance issues can cost businesses millions annually. Traditional monitoring solutions often generate false positives, lack intelligent alerting, and fail to provide actionable insights for maintaining optimal web presence.

### Technical Approach

#### Core Monitoring Architecture
The website monitor employs a multi-layered monitoring system:

1. **Async HTTP Monitoring**: Concurrent request handling with aiohttp
2. **Content Change Detection**: Hash-based comparison with CSS selectors
3. **Performance Metrics**: Response time, availability, and error tracking
4. **Intelligent Alerting**: Smart notification rules to reduce false positives

#### Key Technical Decisions

**Performance Optimization:**
- Implemented asynchronous request handling for concurrent monitoring
- Used connection pooling for efficient resource utilization
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing

**Reliability Engineering:**
- Graceful handling of network timeouts and connection errors
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
