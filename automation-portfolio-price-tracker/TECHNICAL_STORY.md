# Technical Story: Price Tracker

## ðŸ“– Development Journey

### The Challenge
Price tracking across multiple e-commerce platforms presents unique challenges: anti-bot measures, dynamic pricing, inconsistent data formats, and the need for intelligent trend analysis. Traditional solutions often fail to provide actionable insights for optimal purchasing decisions.

### Technical Approach

#### Multi-Platform Scraping Architecture
The price tracker employs a sophisticated multi-tiered scraping system:

1. **Adaptive Scraping**: BeautifulSoup for static content, Selenium for JavaScript-heavy sites
2. **Platform Intelligence**: Scrapy for high-performance batch processing
3. **Data Normalization**: Unified product data format across platforms
4. **Duplicate Detection**: Hash-based product matching across sites

#### Key Technical Decisions

**Performance Optimization:**
- Implemented intelligent caching with Redis to reduce scraping load
- Used connection pooling and request batching for efficiency
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing and partitioning

**Anti-Bot Circumvention:**
- Rotating user agents and proxy management
- Intelligent request timing and rate limiting
- CAPTCHA detection and handling mechanisms

**Analytics Engine:**
- Time-series analysis for price trend prediction
- Seasonal pattern detection using statistical models
- Machine learning for deal scoring and recommendation

### Code Quality Measures

#### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each scraping engine and platform adapter
